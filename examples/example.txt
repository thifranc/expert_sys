C => E
A + B + C => D
A | B => C
A + !B => F 						# A and not B implies F
C | !G => H 							# C or not G implies H
V ^ W => X 							# V xor W implies X
A + B => Y + Z 								# A and B implies Y and Z
E + F => !V															 # E and F implies not V
A + B <=> V							 # A and B if and only if C

# If no facts are initially true, then a simple "=" followed
